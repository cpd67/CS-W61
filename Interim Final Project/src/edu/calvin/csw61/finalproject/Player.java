/**
 * + If you use myBackpack.get(), lowercase the noun (noun.toLowerCase()) when you are passing it.
 * + Everything is lowercase (for making it look nice when printing and it makes things easier if we have everything stored
 * as one case. Lowercase seems nicer than having everything upper case ;) ).
 * + We have a standard pattern when creating a Command:
 *   - We check all of the prerequisites before creating (item needed is present, item in backpack, etc..).
 *   - If so, we create the Command object and execute it with the necessary Objects and a handle to the Player.
 *   - If not, we print an error message.
 * + Test new functionality in TestClass (to avoid bloating the Driver code).
